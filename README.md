Summary:  
This application is used to plan a weeks worth of meals. Start with the mealPlanner.py file to begin your meal 
planning. All of the meals files are sorted by type of meal (breakfast, lunch etc). Once you've created your menu, you can select to save it or start over. By selecting 1, the program ends and you are free to save your meal file, if you press 0 your meal selection will start over. All of the meals are selected at random. This application does not currently allow for the editing of the meal files.
